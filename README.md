# Hackathon-2k18
Basically our idea is that during a  natural disaster there is immense destruction and loss of property and life and also people get distressed due to all these activities and they are unable to find a way out of that situation. Thus, we are planning to make a website wherein people  from all communities from all over India can submit their details and seek for help.We will be uploading various links which will be helpful to the people in way that they willbe able to find a platform where they will not only get the links to contact for support and donation but at the same time they will be able to provide their personal details and submit it to the NGO inorder to get help properly and as fast as possible. 
We are adding blood donation form,regional ngo support form so that anyone can fill up the forms and seek help from anywhere.
